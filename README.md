# Thracia 776 Event (dis)Assembler
**WARNING: VERY WIP**

Here is the code. Install Qt to work with it.

I called it Thracia Event Assembler because it's what it was supposed to be, but it probably can be easily expanded to other games (read: FE4) because there is no actual hard-coded stuff for Thracia (except for default values).
